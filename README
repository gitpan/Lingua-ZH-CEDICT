Lingua/ZH/CEDICT version 0.03
=============================

Lingua::ZH::CEDICT is an interface for CEDICT.b5, a Chinese-English
dictionary file that may be freely used for non-commercial purposes.

The dictionary is included as an UTF-8 text file (converted from
CEDICT.b5 by piconv). Upon installation, the file will be read and
converted into a Storable v2.4 file.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

Requires perl 5.6, although I plan to bring down this requirement to
about 5.5.3.

Depending on your usage of the modules, might require one or several
of the following modules:

Storable
Text::Iconv
Encode::HanConvert or Lingua::ZH::HanConvert
Net::MySQL
